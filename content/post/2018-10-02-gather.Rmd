##Tidy Data is useful Data

###Tidy Data is:

Each observation must have its own row

Each value must have its own cell

the function gather helps to make data tidy

has four main arguments

key & value

key is the new name of a variable that will be created from column names
value is the name of cell values to gather
... which variables to gather
can specify individual A,B,C,D or range A:D
for columns not used -E, -F

examples will come later
